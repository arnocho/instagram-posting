When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go.
There is nothing impossible to they who will try.
The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot.
Life has got all those twists and turns. You've got to hold on tight and off you go.
Keep your face always toward the sunshine, and shadows will fall behind you.
